# Smash Day Trading Strategy
A modified version of larry William's Smash Day trading strategy. Working on Daily timeframe (D1).

## Concept
In an uptrend, a sell-stop pending order is placed just bellow yesterday's low. The premise is, if the uptrend is already happened for a long enough time, a break-of-structure of yesterday's low often become a sign of exhausted trend. Therefore, a trend reversal is likely to come not long afterwards.
